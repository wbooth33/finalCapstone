A simple project I created in Python using OOP classification and defining my own functions. This database was for the use of a Shoe company, which allowed the user to do a number of functions including adding new shoes to their inventory, searching for a shoe in their directory, restocking the shoes when they go low on stock and calculating the total value of stock within their inventory.
