A simple project I created in Python using OOP classification and defining my own functions. This database was for the use of a Shoe company, which allowed the user to do a number of functions including adding new shoes to their inventory, searching for a shoe in their directory, restocking the shoes when they go low on stock and calculating the total value of stock within their inventory.

To run the program, copy the inventory.py and inventory.txt file to a code editor such as VS Code and run the program. Make sure both files are within the same file location.

Once the program starts running, you will be faced with a menu of how you would like to proceed. Simply enter your desired menu option and enter any information the program request to get your desired output.

Screenshot of how the menu will look when running program.

Example of how the program runs when user enter "3" for View all shoes in Directory.
